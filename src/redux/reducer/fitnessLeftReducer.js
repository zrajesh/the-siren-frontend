Getting good sleep and going for walks on my rest days has helped a lot. On the other hand, drinking wine and staying up late have caused my heart rate to increase. I contribute losing my last seven pounds to the cardio I have done while trying to lower my resting heart rate. Just like bodyweight, your resting heart rate can tell you a lot about your fitness, and it’s easier to track if you have a smartwatch. I plan to continue my goal of decreasing my resting heart rate until I reach the low 50s",
