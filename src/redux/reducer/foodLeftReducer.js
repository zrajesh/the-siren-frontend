Team the moist and juicy kebabs with spicy mint or pudina chutney along with sliced onions on the side and there's nothing quite like it. Kebabs typically refer to meaty treats either in the form of skewers or minced patties, which were traditionally made in the tandoor or tawa. A whole lot of spices go into the marinade to build on the flavour, and they are then cooked carefully to acquire the right texture. There are different kinds of kebabs that you can indulge in - galouti, kakori, tangri, Afghani, tikka masala, malai, hariyali, so on and so forth. And there are vegetarian variants too. Yes, why should meat lovers have all the fun?",
