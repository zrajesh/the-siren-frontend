If we think back to our analogy of a web page as a house (Introduction to Web Development Fundamentals), we will remember that we said that JavaScript is the electricity, plumbing, and gas. It is what makes the web page “run”. JavaScript was originally designed to be used purely on the front end as a way for web developers to add functionality to their web pages, and in its early days, it did just that. Recently, the introduction of the “V8 engine” ",
